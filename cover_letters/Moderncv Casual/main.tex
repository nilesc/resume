I'm writing this letter to ask to be considered for the AI@X residency program for this summer.

I believe that I am a strong candidate for this program. I completed my undergraduate in
Computer Science with a focus on Intelligent Systems at Columbia this past Spring, and am
currently enrolled in Carnegie Mellon's Master's of Machine Learning program. In addition to
my coursework, I have firsthand ML experience on a number of different projects, such that I
am comfortable both taking the lead on a new project and efficiently onboarding to an existing
one. As such, I'll be able to hit the ground running, no matter the task.

Furthermore, I have interned at Loon twice, including when it was still a part of X. Because of this, I know
what it's like to work at X, and understand the skills required to succeed there. The problems
X sets out to face are unique, and require a specific way of thinking well-encapsulated in X's tenets
(cutting the Gordian knot, starting with the monkey, etc.). I am also familiar with many of Alphabet's
unique internal tools and infrastructure, minimizing the difficulty of onboarding.

Working at and around X, I have come to have an appreciation for the importance of X's mission. All of X's
projects can tangibly better the world, and in many cases, already have. More than the specific projects,
the philosophy of automating innovation is a key insight that will ensure that breakthroughs continue
to happen so long as it is properly upheld. I can think of no place more exciting to work, and I hope
to be able to contribute to this incredibly valuable mission.
