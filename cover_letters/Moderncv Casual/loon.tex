I'm writing this letter to ask to be considered as an intern for the Loon steering team for this Summer.

I believe that I am a strong candidate for this position. I completed my undergraduate studies in
Computer Science with a focus on Intelligent Systems at Columbia this past Spring, and am
currently enrolled in Carnegie Mellon's Master's of Machine Learning program. In addition to
my coursework, I have firsthand experience on a number of different projects, such that I
am comfortable both taking the lead on a new project and efficiently onboarding to an existing
one. As such, I'll be able to hit the ground running, no matter the task. Furthermore, my coursework
in machine learning has given me the skillset needed to handle the large amounts of data and open-ended
problems that Loon's steering team constantly encounters.

Furthermore, I have interned at Loon twice, including when it was still a part of X. During this time,
I have made several significant contributions, including a system to improve stashing behaviors for
balloons that are not currently serving any specific area, and a system to provide automatic telemetry on
links between balloons, something that was not previously available. Thanks to this, I am already familiar
with large portions of Loon's tech stack and architecture, and would be able to start contribting immediately.

Finally, working at Loon has given me an appreciation for the importance of its mission. By spreading internet
to areas that wouldn't normally have it, either due to disaster or otherwise, Loon connects people and
allows for economic equity and opportunity in ways that wouldn't have been possible otherwise. Loon's radically
different approach to a huge problem can and has changed people's lives for the better, and it's a mission I'm
proud to have been part of, and hope to contribute to further.
